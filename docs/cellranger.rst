Run Cell Ranger tools using cellranger_workflow
------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps below to run CellRanger mkfastq/count/vdj on FireCloud.

#. Copy your sequencing output to your workspace bucket using gsutil in your unix terminal. You can obtain your bucket URL in the workspace summary tab in FireCloud under Google Bucket. You can also read `FireCloud instructions`_ on uploading data.
	
	Note: Broad users need to be on an UGER node (not a login node) in order to use the ``-m`` flag

	Request an UGER server::

		reuse UGER
		qrsh -q interactive -l h_vmem=4g -pe smp 8 -binding linear:8 -P regevlab

	The above command requests an interactive shell with 4G memory per thread and 8 threads. Feel free to change the memory, thread, and project parameters.

	Once you've connected to an UGER node run::
		reuse Google-Cloud-SDK

	to make the Google Cloud tools available

	Example of copying the directory at /foo/bar/nextseq/Data/VK18WBC6Z4 to a Google Cloud bucket::

		gsutil -m cp -r /foo/bar/nextseq/Data/VK18WBC6Z4 gs://fc-e0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/VK18WBC6Z4
	
	``-m`` means copy in parallel, ``-r`` means copy the directory recursively.
	


#. Create a scRNA-Seq formatted sample sheet. 

	Please note that the columns in the CSV can be in any order, but that the column names must match the recognized headings.

	The sample sheet describes how to demultiplex flowcells and generate channel-specific count matrices. Note that *Sample*, *Lane*, and *Index* columns are defined exactly the same as in 10x's simple CSV layout file.

	scRNA-Seq formatted sample sheet description (required column headers are shown in bold):

	.. list-table::
		:widths: 5 30
		:header-rows: 1

		* - Column
		  - Description
		* - **Sample**
		  - Contains sample names. Each 10x channel should have a unique sample name.
		* - **Reference**
		  - 
			| Provides the reference genome used by *cellranger count* for each 10x channel.

			| **atac** refers to scATAC-Seq data (*cellranger-atac count*).
			| This column is optional and the default data type is *rna*.
		* - FeatureBarcodeFile

	The sample sheet supports sequencing the same 10x channels across multiple flowcells. If a sample is sequenced across multiple flowcells, simply list it in multiple rows, with one flowcell per row. In the following example, we have 4 samples sequenced in two flowcells.

---------------------------------

Only run the count part
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, people might want to perform demultiplexing locally and only run the count part on the cloud. This section describes how to only run the count part via ``cellranger_workflow``.

#. Copy your FASTQ files to the workspace using gsutil in your unix terminal. 

	You should upload folders of FASTQS. Each folder should contain all FASTQ files for one sample.

	Example::

		gsutil -m cp -r /foo/bar/fastq_path/K18WBC6Z4 gs://fc-e0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/K18WBC6Z4_fastq

	``-m`` means copy in parallel, ``-r`` means copy the directory recursively.
	
	Note: Broad users need to be on an UGER node (not a login node) in order to use the ``-m`` flag
	
	You can also read `FireCloud instructions`_ on uploading data.

#. Create scRNA-Seq formatted sample sheet for cell ranger count only (required column headers are shown in bold):

Extract feature count matrices from CITE-Seq/Cell-hashing/Nucleus-hashing/Perturb-seq assays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``cellranger_mkfastq_count`` can optionally extract feature count matrices from *CITE-Seq/Cell-hashing/Nucleus-hashing/Perturb-seq* assays. For *CITE-Seq/Cell-hashing/Nucleus-hasing*, the feature refers to antibody. Note that for *CITE-Seq/Cell-hashing*, only Biolegend TotalSeq-A is supported. For *Perturb-seq*, the feature refers to guide RNA. To extract feature count matrices, please follow the instructions below.

Instructions to configure ``cellranger_mkfastq_count``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Prepare one feature barcode file per assay and upload the files to the Google bucket.

	Prepare a CSV file with the following format: feature_barcode,feature_name.
	See below for an example::

		TTCCTGCCATTACTA,sample_1
		CCGTACCTCATTGTT,sample_2
		GGTAGATGTCCTCAG,sample_3
		TGGTGTCATTCTTGA,sample_4

	The above file describes a cell-hashing application with 4 samples.

#. Add assay information into the sample sheet.

	See below for an example::

		Sample,Reference,Flowcell,Lane,Index,Chemistry,DataType,FeatureBarcodeFile
		sample_1_rna,GRCh38,gs://fc-e0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/VK18WBC6Z4,1-2,SI-GA-A8,threeprime,count

	In the above sample sheet, the first line describes the normal 3' RNA assay. The second line describes its associated antibody tag data, which can from either a CITE-Seq, cell-hashing, or nucleus-hashing experiment. Note that for the tag data, the *Index* field is different. The index for tag and crispr data should be Illumina index primer sequence (e.g. D701 in line two). In addition, the *DataType* field is changed to *adt*. The third line describes another tag data, which is in 10x genomics' V3 chemistry. For tag and crispr data, it is important to explicitly state the chemistry (e.g. *SC3Pv3*). The last line describes one gRNA guide data for Perturb-seq (see the *crispr* in *DataType* field). Note that it is users' responsibility to avoid index collision between 10x genomics' RNA indexes (e.g. SI-GA-A8) and Illumina index sequences for tag and crispr data (e.g. ATTACTCG).

Parameters used for feature count matrix extraction
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the chemistry is V2, `10x genomics v2 cell barcode white list`_ will be used, a hamming distance of 1 is allowed for matching cell barcodes, and the UMI length is 10. 
If the chemistry is V3, `10x genomics v3 cell barcode white list`_ will be used, a hamming distance of 0 is allowed for matching cell barcodes, and the UMI length is 12.

For Perturb-seq data, a small number of gRNA guide barcode sequences will be sequenced ultra-deeply and we may have PCR chimeric reads. Therefore, we only keep barcode-feature-UMI combinations supported by more than 10 reads and additionally require the read support ratio, defined as total reads supporting barcode-feature-UMI over total reads supporting barcode-UMI for one feature be larger than 0.25. 

Extracted feature count matrix output
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For each antibody tag or crispr tag sample, a folder with the sample ID is generated under ``cellranger_output_directory``. In the folder, two files --- ``sample_id.csv`` and ``sample_id.stat.csv.gz`` are generated.

``sample_id.csv`` is the feature count matrix. It has the following format. The first line describes the column names: ``Antibody/CRISPR,cell_barcode_1,cell_barcode_2,...,cell_barcode_n``. The following lines describe UMI counts for each feature barcode, with the following format: ``feature_name,umi_count_1,umi_count_2,...,umi_count_n``.

``sample_id.stat.csv.gz`` stores the gzipped sufficient statistics. It has the following format. The first line describes the column names: ``Barcode,UMI,Feature,Count``. The following lines describe the read counts for every barcode-umi-feature combination.
