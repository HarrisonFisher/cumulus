Cumulus WDL workflows and Dockerfiles
=====================================

All of our docker images are publicly available on `Docker Hub`_ and Quay_. Our workflows use Docker Hub as the
default Docker registry. Users can use Quay as the Docker registry by entering ``quay.io/cumulus/`` for the workflow
input **"docker_registry"**, or enter a custom registry URL of their own choice.
